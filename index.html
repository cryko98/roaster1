                <div class="lore-text">
                    <p>In the desolate landscape of the post-bull run era, a great sadness fell upon the degen world. The calls of "WAGMI" turned to whispers of "GM," and the once vibrant crypto towns were haunted by the ghosts of rug pulls and the echoes of "Wen Lambo?" A silent, digital depression took hold, fueled by endless red charts and the bitter taste of missed airdrops.</p>
                    <p>Amidst this despair, a prophecy was spoken in the deepest depths of the dankest Telegram channels. It foretold of a hero not of riches, but of wit. A legend not of a pump, but of a punchline. This hero would not bring another utility coin or a pointless JPEG collection. Instead, it would unleash a new era of joyous brutality: **The Roast.**</p>
                    <p>ROASTER was born from this void. Our mission is not to make you rich (although, who knows?), but to make you laugh. We are the antidote to the endless shilling, the cure for terminal seriousness. We believe that a well-timed, savage roast can do more for community morale than any whitepaper. We encourage our holders to take the roasts generated on this sacred site and use them to spark joy and chaos across the Twitterverse.</p>
                    <p>This is more than a coin; it's a movement. A movement to bring back the good times, one burn at a time.</p>

                        <h3>Phase I: Genesis & Inception</h3>
                        <p>Creation of the ROASTER smart contract (with 100% chance of being bug-free, probably). Deployment of the website (this one!) and airdrop to the founders' moms for maximum decentralization. Initial meme production begins. This is our serious face.</p>

                        <h3>Phase II: The Great Burning</h3>
                        <p>Community meme contest initiated. Winners receive eternal glory and a small amount of token. Development of a secret algorithm that ensures the most cringe posts on Twitter get publicly roasted first. We will hire a professional roaster (comedian) as a consultant, pay them in token, and then roast them.</p>

                        <h3>Phase III: Meme-Powered Liquidity</h3>
                        <p>Listing on a CEX (if they're worthy). Partnership with a prominent influencer who will be mercilessly roasted in every post to prove our commitment to the mission. We will launch a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where community members vote on which cringe project to roast next. The voting will be done via a highly secure blockchain poll. This is a very serious project.  </p>

                        <h3>Phase IV: Global Roasting Supremacy</h3>
                        <p>ROASTER becomes a household name. We will be mentioned in mainstream media articles that don't understand blockchain, and we will be fine with it. A partnership with Elon Musk is 100% on the table, if he agrees to be our first official roast target. The goal is to bring laughter and a little bit of chaos to every corner of the world.</p>
